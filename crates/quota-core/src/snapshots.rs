//! The persisted snapshot read model.
//!
//! Every surface that *displays* quota — the foreground Android app after a
//! cold start, and later every home-screen [`Widget instance`](../../CONTEXT.md)
//! — renders from this file, not from a live process. Nothing here fetches and
//! nothing here holds credentials: a refresh (`crate::refresh`) produces the
//! ordered snapshots and the one aggregate compact-surface status, and this
//! module is only how they survive the Tauri process exiting so a launcher can
//! render a widget with no app running at all.
//!
//! ## Corruption policy differs from configuration
//!
//! `shared-config.json` is *user-authored* and its keys name secrets that
//! cannot be enumerated back, so a file that cannot be parsed is kept and
//! blocks replacement (see `crate::shared_config`). Snapshots are the opposite:
//! wholly *derived* data that the next refresh regenerates, and per
//! `docs/adr/0006-…` "derived snapshot corruption is discarded". So [`load`]
//! never surfaces a recovery — a missing, unreadable, or malformed file simply
//! reads as an empty read model, and the next successful refresh overwrites it.
//! An empty read model is honest: it shows *no data yet*, never invented data.
//!
//! [`load`]: SnapshotStore::load
